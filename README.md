# Problem Solving

A small collection of solutions for Project Euler problems.

## Structure

- `C#/` contains C# solutions.
- `JavaScript/` contains JavaScript solutions.

## Notes

- Filenames follow the pattern `ProblemN` or `problemN` where `N` is the problem number.
- Each file is a standalone solution for that problem.

## Disclaimer
